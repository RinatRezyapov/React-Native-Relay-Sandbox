## React-Native-Relay-Sandbox
This is my React Native and Relay sandbox.

### Sever
To start development server:
`cd server`

`npm run start`

To create `schema.graphql`:

`cd server`

`npm run update`

The `schema.graphql` file will be generated in `client/data` folder.

### Client
To start client development server:
`cd client`

`npm run start`

To generate GraphQL files on client side (update every time you change query):
`cd client`

`npm run relay`
